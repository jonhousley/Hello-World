# Hello-World
First time using GitHub. <br>
After years working in the Marketing industry, I decided to take a step toward changing my career.  I would like to learn how to program using C#, JavaScript and SQL.  Basically, become a full-stack developer.  

I was working as a technical recruiter while trying to find a new Marketing job.  I was begging developers to take high paying jobs I had available.  No takers.  Why are so many people turning down jobs when I was hunting very hard for a new one.  I was in the wrong career.  Time for a change.  Let's do this.
